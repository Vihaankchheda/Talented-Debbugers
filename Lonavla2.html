The Karla Caves, Karli Caves, Karle Caves or Karla Cells, are a complex of ancient Buddhist <br>
Indian rock-cut caves at Karli near Lonavala, Maharashtra. They are just 10.9 Kilometers away<br>
 from Lonavala. The caves were developed over the period – from the 2nd century BCE to the <br>
 5th century CE. The oldest of the cave shrines is believed to date back to 160 BCE, having<br>
  arisen near a major ancient trade route, running eastward from the Arabian Sea into the <br>
  Deccan. The group at Karla is one of the older and smaller of the many rock-cut <br>
  Buddhist sites in Maharashtra, but is one of the best-known because of the famous “Grand<br> 
  Chaitya” (Cave 8), which is the largest and most completely preserved chaitya hall of <br>
  the period, as well as containing unusual quantities of fine sculpture, much of it on <br>
  a large scale. The cave complex is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey<br>
   of India. It is a great place to visit for history enthusiasts and people who love to<br>
    explore ancient architecture and sculptures.

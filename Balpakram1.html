        <h2>Balpakram National Park</h2>
        <p>Balphakram National Park is a national park located in the South<br>
             Garo Hills of Meghalaya, India, at an altitude of about 910 m <br>
             (3,000 ft) close to the international border with Bangladesh.<br>
              It was inaugurated in December 1987 and provides habitat for<br>
               barking deer, Asian golden cat, Bengal tiger, marbled cat, <br>
               wild water buffalo, red panda and Indian elephant1. The park <br>
               is spread over an area of 220 km². Balpakram means “land of<br>
                the eternal wind” according to the myth of the Garo people.<br> 
                The park is also part of the Garo Hills Conservation Area<br>
                 (GHCA), which has been nominated by the Central government<br>
                  of India as a World Heritage Site12. The best time to <br>
                  visit Balpakram National Park is from late October to May,<br>
                   when the weather is pleasant without rainfall. You can <br>
                   reach the park from Shillong by road from Guwahati airport<br>
                    to Tura and Baghmara. Entry fees will have to be paid at <br>

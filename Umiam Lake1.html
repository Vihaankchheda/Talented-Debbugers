        <h2>Umiam Lake</h2>
        <p>Umiam Lake, also known as Barapani Lake or Dam Sait, is<br>
             a man-made reservoir located in Shillong, the capital <br>
             of the north-eastern Indian state of Meghalaya. The <br>
             lake was created by constructing a dam across the Umiam<br>
              river in the early 1960s. The principal catchment area<br>
               of the lake and dam is spread over 220 square km. <br>
               The lake serves as a major tourist attraction for the <br>
               state of Meghalaya and is a popular destination for <br>
               water sport and adventure facilities. Tourists visit<br>
                this spot for kayaking, water cycling, scooting, and <br>
                boating. Apart from storing water for electricity <br>
                generation, the lake also provides numerous ecosystem <br>
                services at micro, meso and macro levels. Downstream<br>
                 irrigation, fisheries, and drinking water cater to <br>
                 local anthropogenic needs. However, due to the rising<br>
                  population of Shillong upstream of the lake, the lake<br>
                   is starting to become highly polluted. The rivers, <br>
                   Wah Umkhrah and Wah Umshyrpi, have become drains in <br>
                   Shillong city. They carry household and market sewage,<br>
                    and industrial waste which drains into the lake1.</p>

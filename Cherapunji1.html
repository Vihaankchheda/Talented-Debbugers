        <h2>Cherapunji</h2>
        <p>Cherrapunji is regarded as one of the wettest places on earth as <br>
            the highest rainfall is foreseen during the year. Tourists from<br>
             around the world come here to see the Dain-Thlen, Kynrem, and<br>
              Nohkalikai waterfalls that are known as the popular waterfalls <br>
              of Cherrapunji. The town encompasses some of the best waterfalls<br>
               in Meghalaya.Major attractions here are Living-Root bridges, <br>
               Mawsmai cave, Seven sisters falls, Eco-park and a garden of caves.<br>
                As it is situated in a forest, it does not have the option of <br>
                luxury stay rather you will get resorts in Meghalaya and some <br>
                hotels in the lap of nature which will be a great fit to stay with<br>
                 family and friends.<br><br>
                 Cherrapunji, also known as Sohra, is a sub-<br>
                 divisional town in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya, <br>
                 India. It is located on the Shillong Plateau, about 35 miles<br>
                  southwest of Shillong, the state capital 1. Cherrapunji is known<br> 
                  for its heavy rainfall and waterfalls. It has often been credited<br>
                   as being the wettest place on Earth, but for now nearby Mawsynram<br>
                    currently holds that distinction 12. The town has an elevation <br>
                    of 1,430 meters (4,690 feet) above sea level 1.</p>

        <h2>Patnitop</h2>
        <p>Patnitop is a hill station located between Ramban Town <br>
            and Udhampur city in the Ramban district of Jammu <br>
            and Kashmir, India. It is situated on the <br>
            Jammu-Srinagar National Highway, 112 km from Jammu, on <br>
            the way from Udhampur to Srinagar1. The hill station <br>
            sits at an altitude of 2,024 m (6,640 ft) on a plateau<br> 
            in the Shivalik belt of the Himalayas1. The river <br>
            Chenab flows in close proximity to this location.<br><br>

            Patnitop is known for its endless meadows and<br>
             panoramic views of the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas. <br>
             It offers activities like skiing and trekking, and is <br>
             also famous for its water springs2. The hill station is<br>
              also known for its street shopping, with dry fruits, <br>
              Kashmiri handicrafts, and Pashmina shawls being popular.<br><br>
            
            One of the significant landmarks in Patnitop is the <br>
            Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Tunnel1. At 9.2 km, it is India’s <br>
            longest road tunnel1. The tunnel starts from about 2 km from <br>
            Chenani town south of Patnitop to Nashri village north of <br>
            Patnitop, reducing the distance from Jammu to Srinagar by <br>
            31 km and bypassing Patnitop.</p>

        <h2>Dawki</h2>
        <p>The Dawki River, also known as the Umngot River and Wah Umngot, <br>
            is a river that flows through Dawki, a little town located at<br>
             the bottom of the Jaintia Hills in West Jaintia Hills district<br>
              in the Indian state of Meghalaya. It is one of the most <br>
              beautiful and clear rivers in Meghalaya, and is also known as<br>
               the ‘Magic River’. The river originates from the south-east<br>
                part of the state and flows northwards, passing through <br>
                several villages before it joins the Brahmaputra River in West <br>
                Garo Hills. The length of the river is about 160 kilometers.<br>
                Dawki River is a popular tourist destination and offers various<br>
                 activities such as boating, kayaking, and fishing. The crystal<br>
                 -clear water of the river is ideal for swimming and snorkeling.<br>
                  The best time to visit Dawki is between October-April, i.e.,<br>
                   the dry months. The river overflows during the rainy season.<br> 
                   If you visit just after the rainy season you can see the <br>
                   waterfalls on the way to Dawki filled with water.</p>

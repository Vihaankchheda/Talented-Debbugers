        <h2>Mawsmai Cave </h2>
        <p>Mawsmai Cave is a fully-lit, rugged limestone cave located <br>
            in the village of Mawsmai, Cherrapunjee of Meghalaya. It <br>
            is one of the oldest and easily accessible caves in the <br>
            region, and is a major crowd-puller attraction of <br>
            Meghalaya. The cave has a wide entrance, but it quickly<br>
             narrows into a constricted path. As far as the cave goes,<br>
              the interior is quite large, and some of the rooms <br>
              within resemble an amphitheater. There are some places<br>
               inside the cave where you will need to squeeze around<br>
               and crawl – and this adds to the experience of cave <br>
               exploration. The Mawsmai cave route that is accessible <br>
               to tourists is not very long and is very safe so you do<br>
                not want to miss out on this unique opportunity. The <br>
                cave is also famous for its fossils, some which you can<br>
                 spot if you spend some time peering at the walls and <br>
                 formations inside. Just make sure it’s not the monsoon <br>
                 time as water fills up the cave and it gets shut down<br>
                  for visitors</p>

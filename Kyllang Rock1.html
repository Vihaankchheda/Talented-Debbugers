        <h2>Kyllang Rock</h2>
        <p>Kyllang Rock is a geological marvel located in West Khasi <br>
            Hills district of Meghalaya. It is a giant grey dome that<br>
             juts out of the pine forests and is about a thousand<br>
              feet wide at its most prominent girth 1. The rock is<br>
               also known as Lum Kyllang and is steeped in folklore. <br>
               According to Khasi legend, it is believed to be the <br>
               result of a battle between two old gods, Kyllang and <br>
               Symper, where they threw large rocks and mud at each <br>
               other 1.The rock formation is surrounded by rare white<br>
                rhododendrons scattered across the depressions and <br>
                bushes at the base of the dome. Old oaks and various<br> 
                native flora add to the natural diversity of the area<br>
                .There is a path which you can climb along with rest <br>
                stops and summer houses along the way 1. The view from<br>
                 the top of the rock is spectacular – from green woods<br>
                  and quaint villages to mesmerizing sunrises and <br>
                  sunsets if you time your hike accordingly.</p>

            Leh is a city in the Indian-administered Ladakh region,<br>
             located in the disputed Kashmir region1. It is the <br>
             largest city and the joint capital of Ladakh1. Leh, <br>
             located in the Leh district, was also the historical <br>
             capital of the Kingdom of Ladakh.<br><br>
            
            The city is situated near the eastern parts of Jammu<br>
             and Kashmir, on the crossroads of the historic “Silk Route”<br>
              from Sinkiang to West Asia and to the plains of India. The<br>
               city lies near the River Indus and is surrounded by the <br>
               Himalaya Mountains.<br><br>
            
            Leh is known for its vibrant culture, diverse heritage, <br>
            unique folklore, and vast meadows1. The city is home to <br>
            several ancient monasteries and structures, including the<br>
             Leh Palace, which was the former residence of the royal <br>
             family of Ladakh1. The palace was built in the same style <br>
             and about the same time as the Potala Palace in Tibet.</p>
